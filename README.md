I am trying to make a Stock inventory Management system that will be used in the smart park company located in rubavu District, western pronvice which is struggling with inefficiencies due to it's manual , paper based system for managing stock services. they need a web based application that handles the management of stock services process made in react js ,tailwind css as for frontend and then a backend using express MySQL dotenv bycrypt and then make me adatabase named SIMS with tables named 'Spare_Part(Name,Category,Quality,UnitPrice,TotalPrice)','Stockin(StockInQuality,StockInDate)',Stock_Out(StockOutUnitPrice,StockOutQualty,StockOutUnitPrice,StockOutTotalPrice,StockOutDate)

the frontend must have The ui features that will enable  user to input his data in the tables above and display required reports.
> Menue bar/Pages of web application should include SparePart, StockIn,StockOut,Reports and Logout options
> The webapplication should be responsive using tailwindcss and lso it must be integrated with its backend

NB: 1. Insert operation should be used on the three forms (SparePart,StockIn,Stockut)
    2. Delet,Update operations should only be used on  stockout form

the backend must be easy to understand and also give me the data to be used in the tables like the demo data
so i have downloaded all the required packages so  doing this project try to make a modern interface a unique one with try to use a random color make it in black and wite and make it using a popup form without green as the best color 
make this project as easy as drinking water so that children can understand well
